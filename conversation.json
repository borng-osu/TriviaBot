                "I retrieve brief Wiki summaries when you ask me 'What is x?', 'What are x?' or 'Who is x?' Ensure that x is surrounded by quotes! \n\nI can also find factoids regarding numerical figures. For example, you can ask 'When did x happen?' or 'When did x live?' The verb can be whatever is relevant, if I can find it on the Wikipedia page. You can also ask questions such as 'How many y are in x?' These are the only two questions types I can handle right now. Again, make sure x is surrounded by quotes!\n\nLastly, I can quiz you. If you simply enter 'quiz', I will find a numerical data question to ask about the last page looked up. Have fun!"
